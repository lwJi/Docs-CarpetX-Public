In all the directories you can find a file called
solution_last.dat. This file contains only the exact solution computed
at the accuracy reported in the paper. This solution correspond to the
last solution written in the file solution.dat which on the contrary
stores the output of each iteration done by the solver during the
computation of the exact solution. The accuracy of each solution
written in the file solution.dat can be found in funcv.dat which
reports the jumps at the contact discontinuity of all the variables.
